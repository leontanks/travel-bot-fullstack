I would not pay for the castle tour. It is limited in what you get to see. The outside is much better than inside!","Level 4 Contributor","8 Helpful votes"

We always take the horse drawn carriage to the landing area. Well worth the 10.50 euro price for round trip.","Level 4 Contributor","15 Helpful votes"

It’s stunning, gorgeous, and relatively young in European standards. However, the crowds were nuts. It took away from the charm, might as well go see the castle Disneyland made (inspired from this) and...More","Level 5 Contributor","15 Helpful votes"
