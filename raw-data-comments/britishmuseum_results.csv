I'm not sure why they don't charge, I nearly said we don't charge, millions of tourists with cheap sterling experiencing all this for free. £20 at the Uffizi and £15 at the Louvre.
Anyway, we headed for Sutton Hoo and Europe, best to plan ahead, we could hardly move in some areas. Worth queuing just to see the ship burial helmet, something you won't forget. Just so much to see and to read, absolutely fascinating.

OnTheCoastAl,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,Date of experience: March 2019,en,"Admittedly, I only had about 1.5 hours to be in the British Museum after I had passed through the security line, so I zipped through a lot of the museum at speed.
I visited on a Sunday afternoon, so it wasn't as busy as it could have been, but it was still plenty busy anyway.
As a speed-visitor, I found it difficult to find certain items. First visit was to the Rosetta Stone, which I found thanks to the crowds when I had reached the correct room. Then I visited the 'library' room, which is massive and impressively beautiful! After a quick wander through the Americas section, I went to the jewel (in my opinion!) - the amazing roof architecture in the courtyard!
I know this isn't the reason to visit the British Museum, but I didn't have the time to immerse myself into the museum, and the glass canopy is truly a work of art!

So I got dressed, had my breakfast and went to see it. I was speechless. It is beautiful as a piece of historical architecture, it is huge (it takes more than one day to see it all) and it is free to get in. Those of you who love history from anywhere in the world and is your first time in London would be those I would encourage to get up early and try to be the first to get in. Close to the tube station and easy to get to on foot once you arrive at Tottenham Court Road. There are many different things to see and seeing them more than once does not make you tired. You learn to see them from different angles. Mine are: I wonder how long it took you to be made? I wonder how long it took for you to be here? I wonder if I will look cool with a picture of this place as my profile (it is such a beautiful place). Serene, elegant and huge. Enjoy your visit and hope you agree.

British Museum will not let them go and its argument is strong: there are many other museums all over the world including Denmark and the Vatican which have pieces of the Parthenon. Why should they be returned? What of the people who can't make it to Athens to see the Parthenon?

But it’s certainly one of the greatest. The breadth and depth of its collections, the wonderful temporary exhibitions they put on, the lectures, the bookshop.
Have a quick tour of the whole place or spend a whole day concentrating on one area. Whatever you do will expand your knowledge of the human experience, if you make the effort.",Level 2 Contributor,5 Helpful votes

lydls,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,Date of experience: October 2018,en,"So we after thinking about things to do in London, my father and I decided it’d be great to go to the British Museum since we hadn’t been in nearly a decade.
It was a wonderful day out since there is more then enough to see in the museum, in fact it would take quite a couple of visits to be able to see the whole museum as there are plenty of area filled with many artefacts and knowledge.
All in all, it is always worth a visit and you’ll be sure to have a great time, even with young children as there is something for everyone, there is also a lovely cafe at the entry of the museum which sell lovely cakes and coffees but mind out; the prices are a tad on the expensive side.",Level 2 Contributor,5 Helpful votes

So many exhibits to see, so impossible to see in one visit. It is a facility where by it would be best to see different sections on multiple visits. We walked from the Tube to the Museum and found it frustrating that there was not some street signs indicating that such a prominent attraction was near by resulting in walking a far greater distance than required.

There is an absolutely vast array of exhibits and artefacts to see, beautifully displayed and all designed to enhance and provoke your interest in history, from our ancient ancestors through to modern times, covering the Egyptians, Romans, Japanese and much more.
The actual building and inside, both amazing, are in themselves worth seeing and experiencing.
As others have said make plenty of time to take it all in properly. Also younger children can get a bit bored, although they do fast track you through the entrance queues :)",Level 5 Contributor,53 Helpful votes

I could easily have spent an entire day just in that wing. I hope to go back some day to see more of their seemingly endless collection. The line was a bit long to go through the security check, but they moved very efficiently. Once inside, it really wasn't too crowded because it's so large.
