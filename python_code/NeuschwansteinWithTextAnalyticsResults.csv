BetsyBtravelin,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,Date of experience: March 2019,en,"Neuschwanstein and Hohenschwangau are within walking distance of each other and tours are by timed ticket. Our hotel (Das Konig Ludwig) arranged the tickets for us in advance so we were able to get them at the centrally located ticket center. I had searched for private or small group tours but there is no such thing - you are assigned the tour time in your language and can go through the turnstile only at that time (in Neuschwanstein you hold individual audioguides that help you hear the tour guide more easily). Each castle provides about a half hour tour, so you have to move through the rooms fairly quickly. While this avoids logjams it does not give you time to linger and view any room you particularly like. That said, the rooms have spectacular artwork and the story of Ludwig II is an interesting one. There are really beautiful views of the countryside along the way as well. We were there in the off season so it was somewhat crowded but manageable; my understanding from German tour guides is that it can be a madhouse in the busy season.

wbkrb,ui_bubble_rating bubble_40,Date of experience: February 2019,en,"In Schwangau you can visit 2 castles.
the castle Hohenschwangau & castle Neuschwanstein.
Both castles lie on a mountain which is a strong walk.
Depending on the season, buses and horse-carriage are available here.
During my visit, it was only possible to use carriages to Neuschwanstein (€ 7, - from valley to castle, € 3.50 from castle to valley). If you are dependent on this, pay close attention to the ""openinghours"" of the carriages. On the day we visited this location this service was only until 16:00.
In the castles are a lot of stairs, and now elevators.
So a visit when you have problems with stairs, than you can better not visit it.
Both Castles are certainly worth to visit.
The castles can only be visited with a guide, because my parents are less good in their foreign languages, I have used the Audio Tour in both castles.
The information given by the audio tour is very nice..
In Hohenschwangau the audio tour is activated by passing the Guide (by infrared) when you are entering a room.
The audio tour in Neuschwanstein is activated when the majority of the group is present in a room (by radio signal).
For Neuschwanstein this means that you are not always in the room about which information is given. Our group was so large that the group did not fit in the room. Because of this you noticed that people were strongly urged to join the group in the front. And you have a short time to watch, becouse you must follow the group. The tour in Hohenschwangau was much more pleasant to visit due to less crowds.
Due to the large crowds, the tour is carried out under a big time pressure (every 5 to 10 minutes a new group starts).
If you book a tour I would advise you to use a spoken tour.

We decided to walk out of town to the ticket office at the base of the mountain the castles, which was pleasant enough, but took a good bit longer than I'd expected, based on the map I had. Tomorrow, we are NOT walking there, but will drive our car and pay the 6 Euros parking fee. There is also a pretty frequent shuttle bus to and from Fussen, which we were lucky enough to catch back after walking all that way.
We arrived with our car at the parking area near the ticket center just before 7:30, being only the second car to enter the lot. There were however a number of people in line at the ticket counter already, since there were other parking lots and other ways to get there. We had no problem getting one of, if not the first English tour for the Hohenschwangau Castle at 9:50, and Neuschwanstein Castle at 11:55.
The walk to Neuschwanstein was supposed to be about 40 minutes, and that is about how long it took us. This walk is not for the feeble, as it is continuously uphill and long. If you aren't in for a climb, I'd recommend either the horse and carriage ride, or the shuttle bus.

AmCan,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,Date of experience: June 2018,en,"Neuschwanstein is ""Mad"" King Ludwig's architectural masterpiece. Now, Ludwig wasn't really all that ""mad,"" and the multi-layered, nuanced story (and mystery) unfolds as you take the tour. The “castle” is a modern invention. Ludwig started it in the late 19th century. It looks like a storybook castle, because it was built to be that way. Ultimately, it’s nothing but a big house, but oh my goodness, what a house it is. It’s a testament to how hereditary elite will spend their people’s money – but that doesn’t detract from its being a work of art. We can now appreciate its aesthetic value (tons of that) and its story. The interiors are amazing to see. Strangely, as big as it is, it’s a more intimate building than other Bavarian castles where opulence served a state purpose. I’m guessing that’s because of how it’s the idiosyncratic vision of one individual. Go. You won’t be disappointed.
Buying tickets: you have to buy tickets at the ticket center on Alpseestrasse. However, you can reserve a time, and by all means do that so you don’t have to wait in line for an hour and risk tickets running out. Tours are sold by time and language. I’d recommend doing what we did which is get a 14 day ticket from the Bavarian Palace Department (Bayerische Schlosserverwaltung). Buy the 14 day pass before you get to Neuschwanstein, and then show it at the ticket counter. You’ll get a decent discount. The 14 day pass will get you into all the other Bavarian palaces at no extra charge. Neuschwanstein’s the only with with an added charge. If you’re going to visit the other properties, you’ll be ahead by buying and using the pass here and elsewhere.
Getting there: Go by car if you possibly can. you can get there by bus, but you'll be limited by the bus's schedule. Arrive early so that you can find a parking space in the parking lots in town. The walk is short from the main parking lots to the ticket office. Watch while crossing the streets; lots of cars, buses, and tourists.
Should I use a tour? No. You can do this one yourself for a whole lot less money, and it'll be a lot more fun. From what I saw, tours don't get you anything that you can't get on your own, and they'll keep you from enjoying what you see at your own pace.
What to wear: It can get hot in the sun, and darn cold when the skies are overcast and the wind is blowing.
Getting from the ticket office to the castle: It’s uphill; by quite a bit. There are three ways to get there. You can walk the whole distance, ride a horse-drawn carriage, or take a bus and then walk. I’d recommend walking one segment, then riding the bus the other way. Buses are crowded. The carriages and buses are at additional cost.
Crowds: it’s really crowded – all the time.
Marienbrucke: Neuschwanstein is at the base of an Alpine mountain on a promontory. You can walk from it to other promontories, and a particular highlight of the trip is seeing the castle from the bridge between two small peaks. It’s the classic view you see in all the guidebooks. Just do it. It’s stunning. Be forewarned, though, that the wind blows strongly at the bridge.
Shoes to wear: Wear something comfortable with good support. I’d recommend a light hiking shoe. If you’re wearing sandals or flip-flops, you’re going to regret it; guaranteed.
Tips: take your own water bottle to save money. There are no water fountains - anywhere (seems to be an American invention). Re-fill your water bottles in the WC. Also, don't be shy packing your lunch. Food is very expensive at restaurants, and lots of folks pack their own. There’s a snack bar in the building which is okay – and convenient, but it’s also very pricey for what you get. I’d suggest walking to the castle, eating, then taking the tour – if you can time it that way. Figure at least three to four hours for the tour and walking the paths.
Who will like it? Adults, couples, and couples with teens, and even the 8 to 12 age group. Wouldn't recommend it for very small kids - they'd be bored stiff, and don’t bother if you’ve got a stroller (wait until they’re bigger).",Level 4 Contributor,44 Helpful votes,0.8146715164,"day ticket, time, ticket office, ticket center, ticket counter, buses, storybook castle, Wear, day pass, walking, main parking lots, Bavarian castles, Bavarian palaces, parking space, couples, risk tickets, water bottles, people’s money, water fountains, bridge, big house, wind, Tours, Bavarian Palace Department, intimate building, small kids, small peaks, nuanced story, extra charge, added charge, modern invention, American invention, opulence, ""King Ludwigs architectural masterpiece"", base, hereditary elite, Bayerische Schlosserverwaltung, state purpose, restaurants, particular highlight, Alpine mountain, tons, skies, mystery, bored stiff, cars, carriages, additional cost, good support, line, trip, goodness, town, Alpseestrasse, snack bar, horse, idiosyncratic vision, individual, light hiking shoe, shy packing, lunch, Food, aesthetic value, promontories, promontory, testament, streets, tourists, Shoes, WC, Tips, Marienbrucke, hours, Adults, teens, language, classic view, age group, stroller, interiors, decent discount, ""buss schedule"", sandals, flip-flops, guidebooks, distance, century, Neuschwanstein’s, Figure, folks, segment, paths, work of, properties, ways, Crowds"

The interior is beautiful however it's not a big loss if you missed the interior, however the exterior is worth the time. Book online ahead of time. You might wait for a long period or tickets might be sold out.
Take train from Munich to Füssen (book the daily bavarian ticket for 25€ round trip, bus ticket from Fussen included), from where take the local bus 78 and pass by ticket office. Then you might have a 30 minutes walk or wait for the shuttle bus or take the horse ride to the castle.
The palace was commissioned by Ludwig II of Bavaria as a retreat and in honour of Richard Wagner. Many rooms in the castle’s interior were inspired by Wagner’s characters. The nomination itself, ""Neuschwanstein"", literally means “New Swan Castle” referencing of “the Swan Knight” one of the Wagner’s characters.
Ludwig II insisted on a detailed plan and on personal approval of each and every draft making the palace as his own creation.
The exterior is Stunning with the white limestone façade. For the interior expect that you don't have lot of rooms to see, however you will be amazed by the small church and he king's bedroom dominated by a huge bed adorned with carvings.
No more than about 15 majestically decorated rooms and halls were finished among the 200 planned. The king never lived to see his full vision realized. Ludwig II only lived in the palace for a total of 172 days.
Neuschwanstein’s location is a fairytale one. It is located in a magnificiant landscape of the Alps, on the top of a hill. It overlooks the Hohenschwangau valley.

PISICAANA,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,Date of experience: December 2018,en,"I visited Munich at the beginning of December 2018. The purpose of this visit was to see the Christmas fairs in Munich. But we booked one day and went out of town and visited the castle.
The tickets for castle have been booked online; I paid when I picked up them from Tickets Center Hohenschwangau. From 1 January 2018, you must get your ticket at least one hour and a half before your chosen time to visit the castle. We chose 14:25 to have time to visit and take pictures until the time of the visit. The maximum lift time was 12:55. The visit takes about half an hour, I chose the audio guide version, in English.
To get to the castle we took the train, a bus to the village where we took the tickets, a bus up close to the castle and about 20 minutes walking.
We took the train at 09:53 at the Hauptbahnhof station Munich to Fussen ( for about 2 hours ). We bought the Bayern Ticket, which is great for the group ( we were 2 adults and a 17-year-old child).
At the station in Fussen, we took bus 78 to Hohenschwangau Castles. The bus ticket is covered by the Bayern Ticket. We descended to the village of Hohenschwangau; Here, at the Ticket Center, we picked up the booked online tickets. After we picked up the tickets, we walked a little bit through the small town, then took the bus to the castle. It pays directly to the driver, the tickets for bus are not included in the Bayern Ticket. The bus left us next to the bridge (Marienbrücke). We walked on the bridge and take beautiful pictures with the castle. We went back to the bus station and we went to the castle. At the entrance, there is a panel where the hours of the tours are displayed - you will know exactly when to enter the castle. The suitcases and backpacks are not allowed to be taken into the Castle. There are no facilities for storing luggage at the Castle.
Inside there is a souvenir shop and a café where you can eat. You can go out on the balcony for pictures of the surroundings.
We returned to the bus station, returned to Hohenschwangau, then to Fussen and took the train to Munich. It is important to check the departure times of the bus to Fussen, so you can check the train to Munich. Not all trains going to Munich are direct and you may miss too much time on the road.

stranger_and_pilgrim,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,Date of experience: January 2019,en,"I have long wanted to visit Neuschwanstein Castle and was really looking forward to it. We were there in January 2019 - in the middle of the heaviest snowfall for the area in approximately 15 years. The snow was amazing and just added to the character of the occasion and gave an almost ""fairy tale"" feel to it. It was quite a trek getting up the hill to the castle - especially in the cold and snow; but very do-able with a modicum of fitness.
Sadly (for us), the castle is undergoing renovations (January 2019), with large tracts of scaffolding across the entire front of the castle and then more in some of the rooms that were part of the tour. The castle itself is stunning to look at from the outside; but difficult to take comprehensive photographs of – in each picture you always seem to be cutting off a tower or missing a part of it. The bridge was closed and off-limits because of the weather, so we were limited by where we could take pictures from. The tour itself was a little disappointing for me – I somehow expected more. It was very short and we only got to see a few rooms - even if most of the other rooms were never completed, it would still have been nice to tour through some of them. The renovations, however, spoiled it a bit for me.
Of the two castles – Neuschwanstein and Hohenshwangau – Hohenschwangua was the better one for me. We did both on the same day and the snow really made Hohenschwangua “stand out”, whereas Neuschwanstein “blended into” the surroundings far more. The one advantage of doing the tours in Winter was that there were no queues and far less people on each tour, so we weren’t tripping over each other to see anything. Getting from Fussen to the castles and back was simple by bus (and free if you stay at some of the accommodation in Fussen, plus you get a discount on your tour ticket price – we were at Central City Hotel). The bus leaves from and returns to the bus stop opposite the train station – it drops you off a short uphill walk from the ticket office near the castles. You then either walk or take a horse drawn carriage from there to either castle.

KaterinaDyrda,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,Date of experience: January 2019,en,"**PLEASE READ THE BOTTOM FOR HOW TO SAVE MONEY GETTING HERE WITH THE BAYERN PASS**
I went with my fiancee to Neuschwanstein for New Year's. Apart from being her childhood dream, it was also one of the reasons that inspired her to learn German. It's really, really hard to put the beauty of this place into only a couple words. And the smile on her face was absolutely worth it :)
I would advise, however, that if you are thinking about traveling here you **absolutely need to buy your tickets far, far in advance.** We purchased our plane tickets in November, and upon checking the castle's website, we discovered that all the tickets were sold out from Christmas to January 4th. Entirely. I don't actually recommend getting the ticket if you are able to climb the surrounding mountainside yourself (the view is far superior than any tour), but if you intended on actually getting inside the castle, you'll likely be disappointed. If you see that the tickets are sold out online, **do not bother waiting in the line at the bottom of the mountain.** I met many people who waited two hours only to be told, indeed, they were fully sold out, and have the entire experience ruined for them. There’s an online tour on YouTube which is far better (you can’t even take pictures inside the castle!). Save your money, and your time, and experience the beauty of the castle yourself.
Everyone says how fabulous the castle looks from the outside, but you will not get this experience if you take the normal path. The people who had the best time are those who hiked up the surrounding mountainside. Here is where you will be able to take those famous photos of the castle that everyone recognizes. The standard path to the castle is rather steep and only enables you to see the front- the mountainside, however, lets you take a complete picture from above. Everyone was mesmerized by the beauty and were extremely friendly. We even got free Polaroid photos from other tourists! If you have difficulties walking/climbing, this can unfortunately be a very big problem. In which case, you are better off only going with a ticket and seeing the inside rather than outside.
In the event that you are hungry, there’s a restaurant with very welcoming staff halfway up the mountain. You can also purchase souvenirs nearby.
Speaking of money, getting here can be an absolute money pit for tourists, solely because Germany has a convenient, but rather confusing, transportation system. To get here from Marienplatz (the center), simply go to any underground kiosk and purchase a Bayern Pass. These tickets, for only about 30 euros, enable you to use ALL of Munich’s transportation for a whole day, starting at 9 am. This includes your metro or bus ride to the train station, the train to Füssen, the bus from Füssen to the castle, and all the way back. You can take any train/bus you’d like- the ticket works for absolutely everything and you are not restricted to certain cars, only ones after 9 am.

Annah E,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,Date of experience: December 2018,en,"The castle is fabulous, full of ornate and splendid things. The location is spectacular and the story of the tragic king is fascinating. Do check out the bridge - a breathtaking view and exciting height challenge.
Unfortunately, the tours are jammed so close together - departing 10 minutes or so - that you are rushed through and have no time to really look and soak up the story.
You can only go on the guided tours, they are not cheap and there are so many people lining up behind you that you are obliged to spend just moments in each section.
The Trust that looks after this wonderful piece of history would serve visitors much better by allowing more time between tours and not rushing people through.
We were there in the off-season and apparently it was 'pretty quiet' with just a 80 or so people milling about waiting for the guided tours to depart. I understand that thousands of people arrive there every day in peak season can't imagine how many people they must be cramming through in peak season. The queues are huge apparently.
An important tip - if you get to the castle in the later part of the day do NOT put your belonging in one of the lockers in the ticket office area. We could not get in to the castle until the last tour of the day, around 4.15pm. The ticket office closes at 5pm. This information is not made clear when using the lockers.
The tour ends at the bottom of the castle and if you take a little time in the souvenir 'opportunities' shops - open til 6pm - you will find yourself quite some distance from the ticket office and you cannot get back in to get your belongings. We eventually found a security guard who helped but only because we were pushy. There were others wandering around who had the same problem. Nobody seemed to care much.
The buses also ended before we could get our belongings. It was a long walk down in the cold.

We went with Radius Tours from Munich, which cost about €110 for two of us. Nothing to complain about there, great guide, good advice and no hanging about for tickets as they do it all for you. A long walk up the hill to the castle as expected. There were horse drawn carriages you could take if you wanted, which would get you about three quarters of the way to the top.
The castle is beautiful, although one end was covered in scaffolding, we appreciated that repairs have to be done sometime. The inclement weather meant the bridge on the ""other side"" of the castle was shut for safety reasons - again, nothing the castle staff can do about that. BUT - the tour...
The guide was disinterested to say the least - she was bored and boring - think Mick McNamara from League of Gentlemen... And as others have pointed out, the groups are too large so you cannot all fit into the room the guide is talking about. 35 minutes to tour all the rooms, including collecting your audio ""stick"", nowhere near enough time to take in all the breathtaking splendour and opulent detail of this remarkable place. We were aware that King Ludwig had never finished the work, so there was no disappointment in the number of rooms - it was just the breakneck speed that we were ushered through them. The Singers Hall was also under repair, so another spectacular part of the tour was a bit of a let down - they should have warned of this when issuing tickets - maybe that was down to Radius tours, but I very much doubt it?
It didn't help that someone in our group decided it was a good place to bring a bored, grizzling two year old. At times we couldn't hear the monotones of the guide above the screaming, so perhaps there was something to be said for it... Maybe a minimum age for visitors would be an idea?

Most of the castle was never completed and remains that way today. Skip the pricey tour and just take the walking trail to the top and view the castle from the outside. The views are amazing from the overlook points. The trail takes about 20-30 minute to walk.

Lucie N,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,Date of experience: November 2018,en,"We decided to visit the beautiful Neuschwanstein Castle and we were not disappointed by the breathtaking look of it. We bought a two-way bus ticket to get to the Castle from Schwangau and tickets to get inside (booked online).
We were a little early for the visit so decided to go to the Marienbrücke (Mary's Bridge), which was amazing. Very nice view on the castle but unfortunately it was crowded which made it difficult to cross the bridge peacefully. We then took the little trail up the mountain next to the bridge to have an even better view of the castle (careful, it is pretty steep, you will need some good shoes to get up there).
Once time was up, we went to the castle....and what a disappointment. We paid 13 euros each for a guided tour which probably lasted 20 minutes. We went through the rooms so fast we didn't have time to look at everything properly. Plus lots of artifacts were covered by white sheets (being restored, I suppose). Finally, some parts of the castle were being worked on, which somehow ruined a bit of the experience (we were not warned beforehand that some parts would be closed).

The castle itself is incredible & well worth the visit. The tour runs every 5 minutes and you are given a handheld audio tour. In my opinion, the groups were too big - often there wasn’t long enough to look around each of the rooms & there were so many people that you either missed-out seeing part of the room, or the audio was telling you about the next room, when you were still queuing to leave the last.
My travel guide had assured me the views from each window were breathtaking - unfortunately the windows were either covered in dust and/condensation and the view wasn’t visible.
The tour is quite short & then you are led to the cafe, which is quite small.

There was nothing impressive except the location in comparison to any other castle. The king only lived there for 167 days then died. The castles were opened up for the public 2 weeks later.

It was amazing to stand on the bridge and see the castle from the other side. A very impressive photo opportunity. Once we got to the castle we had a wonderful guide, but I can't recall her name. She was very knowledgable and spoke very well into the microphone so we could all hear on the audioguides. It's a fairly quick walk through, about 25 minutes as the inside hasn't fully been completed, if you know your history you'll know why. No photos are allowed inside but many opportunities outside. The little town below is also very quaint and there's a few options for lunch or a quick bite. The only thing that was annoying was that the buses to go to the top are quite infrequent and when they come all the passengers are jam packed like sardines.

This way you can skip the line when arriving to pick up your tickets. If you drive there is lots of parking all around the castle. I recommend taking either the horse drawn carriage or the bus up to the castle and then walking down. It is a steep walk up. Make sure to explore around the castle before or after your timed entrance- walk out to Mary's Bridge for a good view.

Eagle525,ui_bubble_rating bubble_30,Date of experience: September 2018,en,"Visiting Neuschwanstein ( NS) Castle has been on To Do List forever ... finally in Sept 2019, I satisfied TDL. We contracted for a private tour of the area of which the castle was one of the stops.
Here is what you need to know when you get there:
You will arrive at Schwangau at the foot of the Mountain on which Neuschwanstein is located. It will be your Jumping off place to go to the castle . You can take the bus or horse drawn carriage ride up to the general area of the castle ( or you can walk up hill) ... depending on your time line ... I recommend the bus up and a walk down or the carriage ride down. Remember, you are on a mountain, and a rugged one at that. When you get off the bus at castle level, go directly to ""The Bridge"". Signs will guide your there and it is a short up hill walk. The Bridge will yield the best photo ops and it may have been built there precisely for the photo ops ... The bridge can often be crowded so best to get this stop of your visitation list early. After bridge photos, walk to the castle, mostly down hill, on paved walkways. Take in the great scenery and photo ops.
Now for the Internal Castle tour: We have seen recommendations against taking the tour and sorry we did not take that advice. Here is why we too are recommending against it: Circular stairs up, up and up; then down, down and some more down. In all we walked the equivalent of 12 flights that day and most all within the castle. We did not see anything there that couldn’t be seen in other castles. So , “If you have seen one … “you have seen them all”, which certainly applies to NS.
The castle tour itself is another reason to avoid the tour. It is possible we just had a bad experience but given the “tourist restrictions” placed upon us it dampened the experience. Here are the restrictions placed on tourists ..."" No photos, Do not touch anything, No leaning on the walls”. And, “Stay with the group”. Now, add a fairly large tour group that easily fills up each castle room visited and you wont be able to take pictures, lean on anything or even touch the walls unless you are pushed into one. Seeing details or taking photos (if they were allowed) was impossible for the crowded groups that toured that day.
Our guide was another negative ... I suspect she has given to many tours and burned out because she had absolutely no sense of humor or semblance of ‘tour guide enthusiasm”. The tour took about 30-45 minutes at best and no dwelling allowed in any part of the castle ... “you will stay with your tour group (period)”.
Now, there were two exceptions to photographs 1) was from the castle porch, 2) the castle kitchen on the way out without our guide.
On your way out there is a video that profiles the construction and development of the castle … it is worth seeing should you take the tour.
As you exit you will pass thru the souvenir shop … save your money and visit shops in Schwangau … you will get more for your money and possibly better selections.
As we finished our tour my wife asked me what I thought of the tour. I said the fist thing that came to mind;"" it reminded me of that hamburger place"" . She says: “What do you mean by that hamburger place?” You know ... the US fast food restaurant called ""IN and OUT Burgers .... where "" IN and OUT"" are the operative words that apply to our tour. That comment remains my best recollection of our castle interior tour. There is one exception and that is the photos taken from the castle porch ... a few great photos and beautiful scenery from the porch balcony
So, folks here is my take on the New Schwasstein Castle ... go to it, walk the grounds. Enjoy and photograph the exterior and save your entrance fees unless you simply have to see another castle interior. Take the carriage ride down to the small city or walk down the hill ( it is an EZ walk down hill) . Tour the some of the shops and spend some of the saved entrance fee money on an ice cream cone or what ever else suits your fancy. Make the best of what that town offers, for it too is quite beautiful and charming. Or, don't take our and others advice and form you own opinion on the castle tour.

chunk2016,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,Date of experience: December 2018,en,"Visited this place in Dec, with my elderly parents and younger brother.
Joined the Grayline tour, departing from Karlstadt, Bahnhofplatz at 830am. Be very punctual as the bus leaves on the dot.
We arrived at Hohenschwangau around 1pm. Collected our tickets and went ahead ourselves to the castle.
I suggest to take the shuttle bus, €2.5/pax for those with elderly and kids. The bus station is easily seen and located as you will have a wonderful view of Hohenschwangau Castle right in front of you. The shuttle bus comes every 20 min or less. So, enjoy your view of the castle King Ludwig II spent his time with his grandfather, King Ludwig I. Both of them had the same birthday, Aug 25, the same day the French celebrated their Feast Day Saint Louis IX of France, patron saint of Bavaria.
If you want to walk up, you will take about 20-30 min walk from the junction of Hotel Mueller. Caution of steep slopes and slippery tarred roads. You may also take a horse cart up/down at a flat fee of €6-€7.
The bus ride up will take less than 10 min. After alighting from the bus, walk to the left heading to the Marien Bridge where you would be seeing the castle from a distance. This is the PERFECT place to picture the fairytale castle. Imagine Belle from the Sleeping Beauty looking afar from this bridge. She will be looking at the same spot as you are.
It was snowing when we were there on the bridge. It was freezing and the snow was wet. It didn’t, however stopped us from enjoying the view. Took my companion, Ele a little elephant, for a fairytale shot.
Walk back to the same place where you alighted from the shuttle bus. Take the left turn and walk for 15 min. You will reach the base of the castle and wait for your Group No and Time. Be very careful, DO NOT MISS your time, even by a minute. The attendant will deny your entry as you will be joining a guided group. You will need another ticket, if you are lucky to enter the castle. The entrance fee is around €25/pax.
You will be receiving a audio stick that you will be using for your trip inside the castle. Note that phones and cameras ARE STRICTLY NOT ALLOWED. There will be at least 2 attendants following your group. So be careful.
You will pass by a few rooms, corridors and chambers. Enjoy the murals, furniture and view outside the castle. Amazing view over the plains and Alps.
Lastly, on your way out of the castle.

jojopeng,ui_bubble_rating bubble_50,Date of experience: November 2018,en,"Female solo traveller. Stayed 2 nights in Fussen. Went to the castle area for 2 continuous days on 29&30 Nov. Took the DB train from Munich Hbf to Fussen, my guesthouse in Fussen gave me a ""Fussen card"" where I can take unlimited bus rides within my stay. Also with this card, u can get a discount when u purchase the tickets to the castle. Small savings but better than nothing
3 months before arrival: book the castle tickets via the main website. I choose my preferred morning time but end up getting a later time on 30 Nov. The confirmation email will take many weeks to arrive . So please don't be panicky like me...
29 Nov: I arrived at around 2pm at Fussen and sun sets at 4.30pm. after checking in to my guesthouse, I immediately went to take the 3pm bus 73 or 78 both will get u there. The place to board the bus is right outside the train station where I arrived by DB train. You won't missed it. The weather forecast says 29 Nov is a sunny day and 30nov it will rain. So I thought since it's a good weather today , I'll just take a few photos of the exterior of the castles and the next day I will just focus to join the tour to see the interiors will do. Going up to the castles is free. If u want to enter the castle and see the interiors , u will have to get the tickets from the ticket center near the bus stop area at Hohenschwangua. It was really cold and not many ppl around when I arrived. Think most tourists usually comes in the morning or early afternoon. The walk up to neuschwanstein castle was awesome. Most forest area is covered with snow. I took some quick shots and not long after , the sun sets and it starts to get dark.
30 nov.: My official day to visit both castles and I have to collect my tickets before 10.10am even though my first castle tour starts 11.30am, the neuschwanstein castle starts 1.30pm. I arrived at the ticket center at 9am, hoping to get an earlier slot but too bad, no luck . I can't change the timing. Even though this is not the peak season to visit, there is still a big crowd. I can't imagined when it's summer . As I still got 2 hours to spare , I went to the Lake right beside Hohenschwangua castle and museum for a walk.I'm glad I'm early ! It's a gem ! Such a peaceful and beautiful lake. It was early and not many ppl and tour group would go there. I loved the walk! So peaceful so serene. If u have time to spare, please do visit the lake and have a walk. Spot the ducks and swans families that lives there ! After the walk, I went up to Hohenschwangua castle and neuschwanstein castle to take the guided tours to the interiors. It's so beautiful inside ! Personally I prefer the Hohenschwangua castle tour than the neuschwanstein castle tour as the group is smaller, the guide did not rush to finish the explanations in Hohenschwangua castle. Each of us have time to view the pieces in detail. As for Neuschwanstein castle tour, I guess it's the main attraction and the main reason tourists came here for. So each group is much bigger and were given an audio machine. A German friend told me if I want to admire the rooms a little longer, just be at the back of my group or even quietly join the next group which are right behind. Still, although not many rooms are completed and open for viewing, I think it's still worth a visit to experience and feel how a lavish lifestyle the king has when he's alive and with money. And, the lake is where he so called ""committed suicide"" . The weather was unexpectedly good and the sun is out which melts most of the snow that I saw yesterday evening. And buses , horse carriages and the Mary bridge are all in operations! How lucky!
All in all, it's worth coming here for a visit. There's no need to book a tour. It's easy to come here from Munich by taking the DB train to Fussen then take a 10 mins bus from Fussen bus station to Hohenschwangua where the castles are. The only thing to note is that u need to book your castle tours in advance is a MUST even during off peak seasons. They will need your credit card details to secure the booking.

The castle is absolutely beautiful. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here. It’s a bit of a hike up the hill from the main town but our guide broke the walk up by stopping several times to tell us about the history of the castle. We had timed entry in to the castle. The tour took just over 30 mins and although others don’t I would recommend it. After visiting inside our time was our own so we ventured to the bridge where you get fantastic views of the castle from a distance. We then walked back down the hill to visit the lake (5 mins left from the bottom of the hill). This was stunning too.
You can look at the castle from the outside for free. Entrance inside cost €13 each.

The walk up to the castle is not that long, less than 20minutes if you are a good walker. Luckily there was neither snow or ice, or it would have been more demanding.
The castle itself is truly striking, and if I was rating only that I’d give five stars because it really looks like a fairy-tale castle. And I might add that it’s a pity that they do not allow to take pictures inside, but I can understand it.
What I cannot understand (and this is why I’m giving only three stars) is why they time groups to enter every five minutes. And the groups are far too big for many of the rooms you are allowed to visit, which means you will get to see little to none of said rooms. The rooms are beautiful and full of details that you will surely miss since, in addition to being crowded, you are rushed from one room to the next, and the next, and so forth having little to none time from the ending of the registered audio and your having to move on.

Bridge trail. Definitely worth doing, but they put up barriers and close the area for the snow. There is no guard though, and we (along with many other tourists) still went up to the bridge, but the trail was not maintained for the winter and slippery, which is why it was closed.
Parking. It seemed as though everywhere in town was about 6 euros per day. I didn't see much way around that...all the lots were the same. Maybe you could park outside of town and walk in if you really wanted to avoid parking fees.
